				<h5>HW1 CSCI1300 UIUX, October 2nd, 2022</h5>
				<h2>Project Context:</h2>
				<p>
					The goal of the project is to understand a publicly visible user interface and design its users personas 
					and journey. 
				</p>
				<h2>About the Interface:</h2>
				<p>The User Interface that I observed for this project is the card reader at Brown University Mail room. 
					The Card reader, painted in black, are either hanged perpendicularly or displayed on a titled desk. The design 
					of the card reader is fairly simple. It has a gap for the users to swipe the card. On the side where the gap locates,
					the designer put a carved arrow, signalling the direction that the users should swipe their card. Right next to the arrow, 
					the designer also places an image of a card with its back side facing the user, signalling that the user should insert the card with its 
					bar code facing the arrows.</p>

				<h2>Interview Experience and Questions:</h2>
				<p>
					On Friday 9/30, I spent 20 mins sitting in the mail room, looking at people swiping their cards to get their packages and letters. There are two groups of 
					card readers in the mail room: one situate outside of the mail room that allow students to swipe in to get into the queue, the other hanged perpendicularly on the 
					computers that allow students to confirm that they have received the packages. The handling of the second group of machines are supervised by mail room staffs, 
					while the first group of interfaces are not. Besides the long waiting time for getting the packages, I noticed that, among all the users that I observed, about 60% percent of them 
					failed to get their card read by the machine with just one swipe. The repeated operation due to error mainly occured when using the first group of machines. Without the 
					extra instructions given by the staffs, some students ended up frantically swiping their cards for multiple times, 
					ignoring the warning that repeated swiping would delay their package processing. To find out more about the seeming difficulty in using this interface,
					I asked the following questions to three random students:
				</p>

				<ol type="1">
					<li>What is your first impression of this card reader?</li>
					<li>What do you expect to happen if you did this [swiping your card]?</li>
					<li> Do you feel like the card reader provide you with enough instruction?</li>
					<li>Is there a difference in terms of your experience using the machines inside/outside the mail room door?
						If so, what do you think contribute to this difference?
					</li>
					<li>
						Do you find this interface successful in terms of learnability? If not, what would you suggest in terms of improving it?
					</li>
				  </ol>  
				  <p>
					The responses that I got from interviews are quite interesting:
				</p>
				  <ul>
					<li>All interviewees' initially thought the card reader to be intuitive and expected it to be quite easy to use.</li>
					<li>All of them agree the affordance of the card reader is strong and the gap provides clear visual cues for swiping.  </li>
					<li> However, all of them have experienced failures using the card readers. For the machines outside, the error was mainly 
						caused by inserting the card at wrong direction. For the machine inside, the perpendicular placement of the machine won't 
						allow readers to exert enough pressure for the card to be read. 
					</li>
					<li>
						Most of the interviewees find the image signalling inserting direction useless. All of the interviewees suggest that
						the designer should have put the image in a different color other than black for a better visual cue. Some of the interviewees
						further suggested that the perpendicular placement of the card reader inside the mail room also hinders them from reading the cues and
						using the machine properly.
					</li>
					<li>
						Most of the interviewees find using the card reader frustrating. However, due to the simplicity of the operation, the interface
						is quite easy to learn. 
					</li>
				  </ul>

				<h2>The Construction of Two Personas: Identify Users</h2>
				<p>
					The users of the card reader machines at Brown mail rooms mainly consist of Brown students. However,
					Brown students include a wide range of characters, and we present you with two persona here:

					<!--style="height:200px;"-->

				<h2>A Story Board</h2>
				<p>
					So what kind of user journey would these persona went through when using the card reader at Brown University Mail room? 
					Let's find out together in the following two graphs, each grid depicting one moment of Christina, our online shopping fan friend's 
					experience using the interface.
